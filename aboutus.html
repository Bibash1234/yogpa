                            About
                        </b> Founder</h1>

                    <p>


                        Peter began his network marketing career 26 years ago after serving as a Sargeant in the
                        U.S. Marine Corps and subsequently following his innate entrepreneurial spirit into the
                        restaurant business.

                        <br>

                        <br>

                        In 1990, Peter fell in love with marketing. He started out in sales, and despite very little
                        industry training, he applied his military experience to his business and quickly became an
                        industry leader. When others noticed his success, they began asking him to host conference
                        calls and develop training tools for their members. With a great deal of success and
                        training experience under his belt, he decided to found his own company called Multiplex
                        Systems in 1998.

                        <br>

                        <br>

                        Since then, Peter has shaken the foundation of the network marketing industry by
                        disassembling the cumbersome infrastructure and completely streamlining the system. He has
                        virtually re-invented the industry. The result? A more efficient, more effective, less
                        complicated, online business model. Limited risk, high upside potential, and incredibly fast
                        growth.
